# TrackUsageApp

## Idea
  The idea is originated that I want to number of hours or programming, as a way to track my productivity. Github doesn't provide this service as it only tracks the number of commits you have. So I wanted to create a program to do so. 
  This idea can be extended to tracking all apps that I am using.

## Planning
First Step:
  FrontEnd: Command Line 
  BackEnd: Tracking App - Python
  Database: (currently) Excel

# TrackUsageApp

## Idea

The idea is originated that I want to number of hours or programming, as a way to track my productivity. Github doesn't provide this service as it only tracks the number of commits you have. So I wanted to create a program to do so.
This idea can be extended to tracking all apps that I am using.

## Planning

First Step:
FrontEnd: Command Line
BackEnd: Tracking App - Python
Database: txt
